#
# Usage: source workit
#       (or just `. workit`)
#
# If WORKON_HOME is set in the environment, use the basename of the
# current directory, and then each of its parent directories, and try
# to find a matching Virtualenv to activate. Failing that, look for a
# bin/activate file off the current directory and then each of its
# parents, and source the first one found.
# 
# This is a convenience command intended to compliment the `workon`
# command that comes with Virtualenvwrapper.
